# altFINS API Examples 

This repository contains a collection of example applications for working with the altFINS Public API v2.

# api-typescript-example application

This project serves as a comprehensive guide and TypeScript SDK for working with the **altFINS Public API v2**.

## Main Goals and Features:

1.  **TypeScript Client**: Provides a fully-typed client (`src/api-client.ts`) that simplifies API communication, automatically handling authentication and data serialization.
2.  **Market Data Retrieval**: Demonstrates working with **Screener**, **OHLC** (Open, High, Low, Close) data, and various timeframes.
3.  **Technical Analysis and Indicators**: Examples for retrieving historical values of indicators like RSI, SMA, EMA, and access to expert "Trade Setups".
4.  **Trading Signals**: Examples for filtering and subscribing to trading signals generated by the altFINS platform.
5.  **News and Metadata**: Access to market news summaries and reference data (coin lists, intervals).
6.  **Interactive Runner**: The project includes an interactive `runner` (`src/runner.ts`), allowing you to easily select and run specific examples without code modifications.

The project is designed modularly, with individual example categories separated in the `src/examples/` directory, facilitating navigation and further development.
